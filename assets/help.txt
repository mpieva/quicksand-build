DATASTRUCTURE PIPELINE

Download all mammalian mitochondiral genomes from the current NCBI/Refseq
release and create the underlying datastructure required by the sediment_nf pipeline.
The pipeline creates 4 folders:
    
    1. ncbi:     raw Downloaded files from NCBI
    2. genomes:  Fasta files grouped by Family
    3. masked:   For all fasta files in 'genomes' a bed file created by dustmasker
    4. kraken:   For the given kmers (see nextflow.config) the corresponding kraken databases
    
USAGE:
nextflow run main.nf --outdir <PATH>

required:
    --outdir  PATH:   path to the save-dir. e.g. "/mnt/scratch/.../out"

optional:
    --kraken  PATH:   path to your kraken installation folder.
                      default: '/home/merlin_szymanski/Kraken/install'
    
    --kmers   ARRAY:  please change that in the nextflow.config file
